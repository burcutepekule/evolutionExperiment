# Parameter estimation for the long-term serial passage evolution experiment
Parameter estimation repository for the manuscript _"Testing strategies to reduce antibiotic resistance by liquid handling robotics"_  by Daniel C. Angst, Burcu Tepekule, Balazs Bogos, Lei Sun, Sebastian Bonhoeffer.

# Getting started

Bash scripts in this repository are specifically organized to work in an LSF batch system that has a MATLAB module. MATLAB codes can be used locally without the bash scripts. 

### Cloning the repository
1) Open the Terminal and ssh to your LSF batch system.
2) Go to the directory you wish to clone the repository. As an example, you can create a new directory called ``ROBOT``  first,

```sh 
$ mkdir ROBOT
```

go to that folder

```sh 
$ cd ./ROBOT/
```

and then clone the repository by typing the following

```sh 
$ git clone https://github.com/burcutepekule/evolutionExperiment.git
```
You will have a folder named ``evolutionExperiment`` in your new ``ROBOT`` folder including all files necessary to run the simulations.

# Running Simulations & Data Processing
### Bash Scripts

``RUN_INDEPENDENT_ESTIMATION.sh`` :  Bash script to run the independent parameter estimation, and generate the time series predictions using the estimated parameters.<br/>
``RUN_SIMULTANEOUS_ESTIMATION.sh`` : Bash script to run the simultaneous parameter estimation, and generate the time series predictions using the estimated parameters.

### MATLAB Functions

``MCMC_ROBOT_INDP_RUN_PARALLEL(njumps,nchains,chainIdx,commIdx)`` :  The main MATLAB function that runs the MCMC algorithm for independent estimation. It runs one chain at a time, and it is used in a for loop in the bash script to run as many chains in parallel as the user wants. It takes 4 inputs, 

``njumps`` : Number of jumps per Markov chain.<br/>
``nchains``: Number of chains to be run in parallel in total. (This is required for the proper naming of the folders).<br/>
``chainIdx``: Index of the chain that is currently being run. (This is required for the proper naming of the files, and to change the seed for the random number generator.)<br/>
``commIdx``: This is the "community index". As mentioned in the manuscript, there are 3 different experimental scenarios with different community composition. To run the code for each scenario, manipulate the ``commIdx`` variable as described below. 

| ``commIdx``   | Scenario | 
| ------------- |-------------| 
| 0 | Scenario âˆ… : no inflow of resistance | 
| 1 | Scenario I : inflow of both single resistances | 
| 2 | Scenario II : inflow of both single and double resistances | 

``RUN_MCMC_ALL_INDP_PARALLEL(readDataDirec,commIdx,therapy,offset,LB,UB,x0,burnin,sampleevery,njumps,prior,sig,filname)`` : MATLAB function that sets the options for the Metropolis-Hastings algoritm to run. 

``readDataDirec`` : Directory to read the experimental data from. <br/>
``commIdx``: Community index (explained above). <br/>
``therapy``: Index of the treatment arm that will be used for parameter estimation. (These indexes are used within the other functions as well to indicate a certain treatment.) <br/>


| ``therapy``   | Treatment | 
| ------------- |-------------| 
| 1 | no treatment | 
| 2 | mono A | 
| 3 | mono B | 
| 4 | combination | 
| 5 | cycling | 
| 6 | mixing | 


``chainIdx``: Index of the chain that is currently being run. (This is required for the proper naming of the files, and to change the seed for the random number generator.)<br/>
``commIdx``: This is the "community index". As mentioned in the manuscript, there are 3 different experimental scenarios with different community composition. To run the code for each scenario, manipulate the ``commIdx`` variable as described below. 


### Workflow

1) Open the Terminal
2) Go to the directory you have cloned the repository. Considering the example above, go to the ``ROBOT/evolutionExperiment`` folder,

```sh 
$ cd ./ROBOT/evolutionExperiment/
```
3) Give permission to the bash script (depending on the estimation you will run, here, it is demonstrated for independent estimation) by typing the following

```sh
$ chmod +x ./RUN_INDEPENDENT_ESTIMATION.sh
```

4) Run the bash script by typing the following 

```sh
$ ./RUN_INDEPENDENT_ESTIMATION.sh
```
The bash script will read the necessary data from the subfolder called ``EXPERIMENTAL_DATA``, and will save the estimation results to the subfolder called ``SIMULATION_RESULTS``.
